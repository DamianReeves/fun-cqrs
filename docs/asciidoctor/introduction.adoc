## Introduction

**Fun.CQRS** is a Scala library for building CQRS/ES application. It provides the basic blocks to build event driven aggregates with **Event Sourcing**.

**Fun.CQRS** provides a out-of-the-box `AkkaBackend` and a `InMemoryBackend` for testing. However, it's designed as such that other backend implementations are possible. For instance, an alternative Akka backend based on https://github.com/RBMHTechnology/eventuate[Eventuate, window="_blank"], a Slick backend or RxScala backend could be implementated and plugged in easily.

When using the `AkkaBackend`, Aggregates are immutable classes (case class) that live inside an `Actor`. You don't have to deal much with Akka and it's powerful abstractions, instead you concentrate in modeling your aggregate behavior and its protocol (`Commands` and `Events`). However you still need a minimal understanding of how Akka works and how to configure Akka Persistence to use your persistence plugin of choice.

That said, in **Fun.CQRS**, Aggregates are NOT Actors. The **Actor System** is used as a middleware to manage the aggregates, hold them in-memory, store events, recover aggregate states and generate read models via  **Events Projections**
