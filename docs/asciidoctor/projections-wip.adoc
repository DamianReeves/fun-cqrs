## Projections

So far we have seen how we define and work with Aggregates (the write model). In this section we show how to define **Projections** to generate the read model.

A **Projection** is nothing more than an **Query** and a **Event Listener** to react to each `Events` produced by the **Query**. That said, **Projections** are not only useful for generating read models (aka Views), but also for **Sagas** for instance where `Events` coming from one Aggregate produces `Commands` on another Aggregate.

Furthermore, a **Projection** must keep track of the last processed event and have the means to persist it to avoid reprocessing all the events all over again on each system restart. As such, a **Projection** has a state and its state is the last processed event.


### AkkaBackend Projections

The **AkkaBackend** implements **Projections** on top of the new **Akka Persistence Query** module.
